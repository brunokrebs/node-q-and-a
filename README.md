# Backend for frontend exercise

This backend should support the Tachometer app.

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

This last command will print `listening on port 3001`. After that, you can spin up the frontend and make both interact.

> **Note:** if you are using something remote development, make sure `3001` is forwarded and that `3000` (the frontend app) can reach out to it through your machine.
